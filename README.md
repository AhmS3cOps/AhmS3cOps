# Hi, I'm Ahmed Mohammed! üëã  
I‚Äôm an aspiring Network Engineer with a passion for networking, cybersecurity, and technology. I have a solid foundation in core networking concepts and security principles, and I‚Äôm actively expanding my knowledge in both areas. My current focus is on building practical experience to become a proficient Network Engineer, with a strong emphasis on implementing cybersecurity best practices in network design and defense.

## üîí Cybersecurity Projects & Labs:

- **Traffic-Analysis-Wireshark**  
  - A repository dedicated to malware analysis using Wireshark. It includes detailed traffic analysis, packet captures, and insights into network behavior to aid in understanding and mitigating malicious activities.
  - [View Project](https://github.com/AhmS3cOps/Traffic-Analysis-Wireshark)

- **STP-Security-Lab-Root-Guard-BPDU-Guard**  
  - This project demonstrates how to secure a switched network in Cisco Packet Tracer using Spanning Tree Protocol (STP) features: Root Guard and BPDU Guard. These mechanisms prevent rogue switches from becoming the root bridge and disrupting network topology.
  - [View Project](https://github.com/AhmS3cOps/STP-Security-Lab-Root-Guard-BPDU-Guard)

- **VLANs-Lab**  
  - This project demonstrates the creation of VLANs in Cisco Packet Tracer, utilizing trunking to enable inter-switch communication.
  - [View Project](https://github.com/AhmS3cOps/VLANs-Lab)
 
- **CrackingHashPasswords-Dictionary-Attack**  
  - Demonstrates how to crack hashed passwords using a dictionary attack approach. The script utilizes the MD6 hashing algorithm for demonstration purposes.
  - [View Project](https://github.com/AhmS3cOps/CrackingHashPasswords-Dictionary-Attack-)
 
- **Computer Network Simulation in Cisco Packet Tracer**  
  - This project demonstrates the setup and simulation of a computer network using Cisco Packet Tracer. It covers configuring routers, switches, and PCs, setting up IP addresses, and verifying connectivity between devices across subnets.
