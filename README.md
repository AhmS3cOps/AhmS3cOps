# Hi, I'm Ahmed Mohammed! üëã  
Cisco Certified Network Associate (CCNA) with practical experience in network configuration, troubleshooting, and cybersecurity tools. Solid foundation in routing, switching, and network security principles. Organized and motivated to contribute effectively in dynamic IT environments, with a strong focus on implementing cybersecurity best practices and continuous hands-on learning.

## üîí Projects & Labs:

- **Personal VPN Setup**  
  - Deployed a secure, self-hosted VPN server using WireGuard on Oracle Cloud‚Äôs Always Free Tier infrastructure. This project involved configuring a cloud-based Ubuntu VPS, setting up WireGuard server and client configurations, securely transferring client keys, and verifying encrypted tunneling with IP masking. Learned to manage firewall rules, troubleshoot service states, and understand core VPN concepts like peer authentication, IP routing, and DNS tunneling.

- **Python Projects**  
  - This repository contains multiple Python-based projects, each demonstrating core concepts in automation, cybersecurity, and scripting.
  - [View Project](https://github.com/AhmS3cOps/Python-Projects)
 
- **Campus-Network-Configuration-Lab**  
  - This project covers the full setup of a campus network in Cisco Packet Tracer: VLANs, trunking, spanning-tree optimization, redundancy with HSRP, routing with EIGRP, DHCP services, NAT/PAT configuration, and Internet access verification.
  - [View Project](https://github.com/AhmS3cOps/Campus-Network-Configuration-Lab)

- **F1-Race-Analysis-and-Prediction**  
  - This project involves the development of a data science application that explores historical Formula 1 (F1) race data and uses machine learning models to predict the outcome of races. The application will analyze driver and constructor performance, circuit statistics, and other race-related features to predict whether a driver will finish a race and possibly finish in the top positions.

- **STP-Security-Lab-Root-Guard-BPDU-Guard**  
  - This project demonstrates how to secure a switched network in Cisco Packet Tracer using Spanning Tree Protocol (STP) features: Root Guard and BPDU Guard. These mechanisms prevent rogue switches from becoming the root bridge and disrupting network topology.
  - [View Project](https://github.com/AhmS3cOps/STP-Security-Lab-Root-Guard-BPDU-Guard)
    
- **Movie Booking System**  
  - A full-featured movie booking system built with MongoDB, Express, React, and Node.js (MERN). Users can browse movies, watch trailers, select seats and showtimes, book tickets with Stripe payments, and manage their profiles securely using JWT authentication and bcrypt hashing. The system ensures smooth navigation and robust validation for an optimal user experience.
